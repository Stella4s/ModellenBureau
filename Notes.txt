Notes


MODEL
- Add image collection to model.
- Add supporting image class.
- Add sizes to Model.

CUSTOMER
- Add logo

GENERAL
[Solved differently] - Try partial views in combination with registering user.
To load both UserRegistering pages as well as the model pages for both Customer and Photomodel respectively.

[Fixed] - Solve Photomodel.User properties not displaying in CRUD pages.

- Adding image models for both uploading to Database as well as uploading to filesystem.
Note: Currently only using imagemodel for Database on Customer and PhotoModel Models.
